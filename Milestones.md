# Milestones List

Below is a list of major project milestones for DraftVision, including expected deliverables and a short explanation of each stage of development.

### Milestone 1: Data Acquisition Completed  
All historical player performance, athletic testing, and contextual datasets are collected, inspected, and stored in the project repository. This milestone ensures that the raw data foundation for DraftVision is stable and ready for preprocessing.

### Milestone 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering Completed  
The raw datasets are cleaned, standardized, merged, and converted into model-ready features. This milestone results in a reproducible data pipeline and a finalized feature set.

### Milestone 3: Model Development and Selection Completed  
Baseline and advanced machine learning models are trained, evaluated, tuned, and validated. A final model is selected and registered for use by the Prediction Service.

### Milestone 4: Backend API Completed  
The Prediction Service backend is fully implemented, including player lookup, inference logic, input validation, and explanation generation. Successful end-to-end test predictions are achieved.

### Milestone 5: Frontend User Interface Completed  
The user interface for player search, results display, and visual output components is completed and integrated with backend API endpoints.

### Milestone 6: System Deployment Completed  
The full DraftVision system (backend + frontend) is deployed to a production-ready environment. Logging, monitoring, and reliability checks are verified.

### Milestone 7: Final Testing, Refinement, and Documentation  
Usability testing, final model evaluation, bug fixes, refinements, and complete system documentation (architecture, workflows, deployment steps) are fully completed.

### Milestone 8: Final Deliverables Submitted  
All senior design deliverables—including diagrams, task lists, reports, presentations, and the working system—are completed and uploaded as required.
