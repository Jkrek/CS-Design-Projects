## Project Tasks

1. Identify all historical datasets needed for player performance, athletic testing, and contextual variables so that the system has reliable raw data for modeling.

2. Obtain raw football data from approved public sources and load it into the project’s data storage system so that preprocessing can begin.

3. Clean and standardize all player-level datasets to ensure consistent formats, naming conventions, and handling of missing values.

4. Engineer model-ready features from statistical performance data, athletic metrics, positional indicators, and contextual variables to prepare inputs for training.

5. Document all preprocessing and feature engineering steps so that the data pipeline remains reproducible and well understood.

6. Design the model selection strategy using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, AUC, and calibration to determine the best modeling approach.

7. Develop a supervised learning model to compare baseline and advanced model performance for predictive accuracy.

8. Train selected model using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning so that the final model is optimized and stable.

9. Validate the trained models using test sets, calibration checks, and fairness considerations to ensure sound and trustworthy predictions.

10. Register the final chosen model in the model storage system so that the Prediction Service can retrieve and use it for inference.

11. Design the backend architecture, including API endpoints for player lookup and model inference, to support real-time predictions.

12. Develop the backend API to handle input validation, model loading, feature construction, and prediction generation.

13. Integrate the backend API with the player metadata and statistics database so that player queries return accurate data.

14. Test backend data flow, model loading, and output formatting to ensure correct end-to-end system behavior.

15. Implement explanation features such as feature importances and key driver summaries so that users can understand prediction outputs.

16. Design the web interface, including the player search form and results display, to provide an intuitive user experience.

17. Develop the frontend application and connect it to backend API endpoints so that users can receive predictions in real time.

18. Create visual components that display prediction probabilities, comparisons, and summary insights for users.

19. Log prediction requests and system outputs to support monitoring, debugging, and tracking of model versions.

20. Deploy the full DraftVision system, including the backend and frontend, to a production-ready hosting environment.

21. Evaluate system usability and responsiveness through user testing so that improvements can be made based on actual interactions.

22. Refine the system by improving model performance, interface clarity, or backend efficiency based on testing feedback.

23. Document the architecture, workflows, model details, and deployment instructions to support long-term maintainability.

24. Prepare final deliverables and presentation materials for senior design evaluation and submission.

25. Maintain version control for all project components to ensure that changes are tracked and development remains organized.
